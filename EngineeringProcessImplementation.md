## 4. Code Changes Implementation

### 4.1 Development Environment Setup

```bash
# Ensure you're on the feature branch
git checkout feature/newsletter-selection-flow

# Install dependencies
npm install  # or yarn install

# Set up local environment
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with local configuration

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### 4.2 Using AI for Implementation

**Starting an Implementation Session**:

```bash
# Start Claude Code in your repository
claude code
```

**Prompt Template for Implementation**:

```
I'm implementing the feature defined in design-docs/[feature-name].md

The design has been reviewed and approved. I need to implement [specific component/feature].

Context:
- Approved design doc: design-docs/[feature-name].md
- Current working branch: feature/[feature-name]
- Tech stack: [list relevant technologies]

Please help me implement this following our approved design. Let's start with [first component/file].
```

### 4.3 Incremental Development Pattern

**Recommended approach**:

1. **Start Small**: Implement the minimum viable component first
2. **Commit Often**: Commit stable states every 30-60 minutes
3. **Test As You Go**: Run tests after each component
4. **Document Changes**: Add inline comments for complex logic

**Example workflow**:

```bash
# Implement data model
# - Create migration
# - Update schema
# - Generate types
git add -A
git commit -m "feat: Add newsletter preference data model"

# Implement API endpoint
# - Create route handler
# - Add validation
# - Write tests
git add -A
git commit -m "feat: Add newsletter preference API endpoint"

# Implement UI component
# - Create component
# - Add styles
# - Write component tests
git add -A
git commit -m "feat: Add newsletter selection UI component"
```

### 4.4 Code Organization Standards

**File Structure** (example for a feature):

```
src/
  features/
    newsletter-selection/
      components/
        NewsletterSelectionForm.tsx
        NewsletterSelectionForm.test.tsx
        NewsletterCheckbox.tsx
      hooks/
        useNewsletterPreferences.ts
        useNewsletterPreferences.test.ts
      api/
        newsletter.ts
        newsletter.test.ts
      types/
        newsletter.types.ts
      utils/
        newsletterValidation.ts
        newsletterValidation.test.ts
      index.ts  # Public API of the feature
```

### 4.5 AI-Assisted Refactoring

If AI goes off track:

```bash
# Reset to last good commit
git log --oneline -10  # Find last good commit
git reset --hard <commit-hash>

# Start fresh with more specific instructions
claude code
```

**Prompt for Course Correction**:

```
The previous implementation didn't match our design. Let me clarify:

Design requirement: [specific requirement from design doc]

What was implemented: [describe what went wrong]

What should be implemented: [describe correct approach]

Please help me implement this correctly.
```

# Create pre-commit hook
cat > .husky/pre-commit << 'EOF'
#!/usr/bin/env sh
. "$(dirname -- "$0")/_/husky.sh"

# Run linter
npm run lint

# Run tests
npm test -- --passWithNoTests

# Run type checking (if TypeScript)
npm run type-check

echo "✅ Pre-commit checks passed"
EOF

chmod +x .husky/pre-commit
```

### 6.4 Handling Test Failures

**If tests fail on commit**:

1. **Review the failure**:

```bash
npm test -- --verbose
```

2. **Use AI to diagnose**:

```bash
claude code
```

**Prompt for Test Diagnosis**:

```

2. Suggest a fix
3. Explain why the test is failing
```

3. **Fix the issue**:
   - Option A: Fix the code if there's a bug
   - Option B: Update the test if it's incorrect
   - Option C: Update both if design changed

4. **Re-run tests**:

```bash
npm test
```

5. **Commit when tests pass**:

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "fix: Resolve [issue description]"
```

### 6.5 Commit Frequency

**Recommended cadence**:

- Commit every stable state (every 30-60 minutes)
- Each commit should be a logical unit of work
- If you're unsure, it's better to commit more often
- Use meaningful commit messages

### 8.2 Build Failure Handling

**When a build fails**:

1. **Check the CI logs**:

```bash
# View workflow runs
gh run list

# View specific run
gh run view [run-id]

# View logs
gh run view [run-id] --log
```

2. **Reproduce locally**:

```bash
# Run the same commands as CI
npm ci
npm run lint
npm run type-check
npm test -- --coverage
npm run build
```

3. **Use AI for diagnosis**:

**Prompt for Build Failure Diagnosis**:

```
My build is failing in CI with the following error:

[Paste CI error logs]

Build configuration: [describe build setup]

Please help me:
1. Identify the root cause
2. Suggest a fix
3. Explain how to prevent this in the future

Also check if this is:
- A dependency issue
- A configuration issue
- A code issue
- An environment difference between local and CI
```

4. **Fix and push**:

```bash
[Make fixes]
git add -A
git commit -m "fix: Resolve CI build failure"
git push
```

### 8.3 Build Optimization

**Monitoring build times**:

Create `.github/workflows/build-metrics.yml`:

```yaml
name: Build Metrics

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  metrics:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Build with timing
        run: |
          START=$(date +%s)
          npm run build
          END=$(date +%s)
          DURATION=$((END - START))
          echo "Build time: ${DURATION}s"

          if [ $DURATION -gt 300 ]; then
            echo "⚠️ Build time exceeds 5 minutes"
          fi
```

## 10. Monitoring Implementation

### 10.1 Error Monitoring Setup

**Example: Sentry Integration**

```javascript
// lib/sentry.js
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/nextjs";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN,
  environment: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ENV,
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});

// Usage
try {
  // Code that might throw
} catch (error) {
  Sentry.captureException(error, {
    tags: {
      feature: 'newsletter-selection',
      userId: user.id,
    },
  });
}
```

### 10.2 Automated Error Triage

**AI-Assisted Error Analysis**:

Create `.github/workflows/error-triage.yml`:

```yaml
name: Error Triage

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 */4 * * *'  # Every 4 hours
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  triage:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Fetch recent errors
        id: errors
        run: |
          # Fetch errors from Sentry API
          curl -X GET "https://sentry.io/api/0/organizations/[org]/issues/" \
            -H "Authorization: Bearer ${{ secrets.SENTRY_TOKEN }}" \
            > errors.json

      - name: Analyze with AI
        run: |
          # Use Claude API to analyze errors
          # This is a placeholder - implement based on your setup
          echo "Analyzing errors..."

      - name: Create issues for critical errors
        run: |
          # Parse AI analysis and create GitHub issues
          # for critical/recurring errors
          echo "Creating issues..."
```

### 10.3 Manual Error Investigation with AI

**Prompt for Error Investigation**:

```
I need help investigating a production error.

Error:
[Paste error message and stack trace]

Context:
- Feature: [feature name]
- Environment: [staging/production]
- Timestamp: [when it occurred]

```

### 10.4 Performance Monitoring

**Example: Core Web Vitals Monitoring**

```javascript
// lib/analytics.js
export function reportWebVitals(metric) {
  // Log to analytics service
  console.log(metric);

  // Send to analytics endpoint
  if (metric.value > threshold[metric.name]) {
    // Alert on poor performance
    fetch('/api/performance-alert', {
      method: 'POST',
      body: JSON.stringify(metric),
    });
  }
}

// pages/_app.js
export { reportWebVitals };
```

### 10.5 Incident Response Process

**When an incident occurs**:
